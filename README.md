# Smile Pro API  

**Smile Pro API** is a commercial-grade application designed to provide a comprehensive and scalable solution for managing business operations. Built with modern technologies and a focus on performance, this system is tailored for companies requiring efficient data handling, multi-tenant support, and high scalability.  

## üöÄ Project Overview  

Smile Pro API is not a simple application‚Äîit's a powerful backend solution built to handle complex business processes. It leverages **multi-schema PostgreSQL architecture**, ensuring seamless data isolation for different tenants while maintaining optimal performance.  

With over **30 API endpoints**, the system is designed to support a wide range of functionalities, making it a reliable backbone for enterprise applications. As the business logic has evolved throughout development, the architecture has been continuously refined to maintain efficiency and scalability.  

##  Key Features

### **Multi-Schema PostgreSQL for Tenant Isolation**  
- The application uses a **multi-schema approach** in PostgreSQL to separate and manage data for different clients.  
- This ensures that data integrity and security are maintained while allowing for easy scaling.  
- Multi-tenancy is implemented efficiently to avoid unnecessary data duplication and optimize queries.  

### **Robust and Scalable API**  
- Over **50 well-structured API endpoints**, supporting various business functions.  
- Built using **Django and Django REST Framework**, ensuring reliability and maintainability.  
- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.  

### **Performance and Efficiency**  
- The application is designed to handle a large volume of requests efficiently.  
- It processes **approximately 300 objects with significant computations**, ensuring fast and accurate data handling.  
- Continuous optimization is performed to enhance responsiveness and reduce load times.  

### **Rust-Based Microservice for Time Slots**  
To further improve performance, a **microservice written in Rust** is currently in development for handling time slots.

- Preliminary benchmarks show that this Rust-based microservice is **10x faster** than existing implementations in Django.  
- Rust's performance benefits, such as **zero-cost abstractions, memory safety, and efficient concurrency**, contribute to this significant speed increase.  
- This microservice will eventually integrate seamlessly with the main Django-based system, providing a **high-performance hybrid architecture**.  

## Tech Stack
